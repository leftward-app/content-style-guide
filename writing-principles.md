With everything we write, we want to be:

### Transparent
- Show the process
- Acknowledge what you don't know
- Make content private only if you have to

### Respectful
- Affirm and encourage
- Don't patronize
- Don't shame or guilt
- Be considerate and inclusive

### Human
- Write like you talk
- No corporate speak
- No bullshit
- No jargon

### Accessible
- [Write to be translated](https://github.com/mailchimp/content-style-guide/blob/master/13-writing-for-translation.html.md)
- Keep paragraphs short
- Does this piece make sense without images?
