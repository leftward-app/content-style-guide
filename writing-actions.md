# Action Sourcing Guide

## What's an action?
**Actions are the heart of what makes Leftward a valuable tool.**

Actions are a single, specific thing, that an individual can do. 

### Action format vs substance
This guide is focused on how we effectively present actions to users. That includes how to write good instructions, what information needs to be gathered, and which kind of things we're looking for. This guide does not focus on the process for vetting or analyzing the content or relevance of the action. That can be found [here](https://github.com/leftward-app/mission-style-guide/blob/main/mission.md#how-we-vet).

### Things every action should have

#### Title
Do:
- Be specific. Make it clear what the action is.
- Keep length within 80-100 characters.

Don't:
- State the cause. There's an icon for that.
- Include other information that is revealed when drilling into the action, e.g. the organization.

#### Organization
The organization sponsoring the action.

#### Cause
The causes the action supports. One or more of the following:
- Economic Justice
- Criminal Justice Reform
- Environmental Justice
- Racial Justice
- LGBTQ+

#### Time to Complete
Estimated time to complete the action, in 5 minute increments, minimum 5 minutes. After 30 minutes, estimate in hours. 

#### Depth

- "Quick Action"
- "Project"
- "Engagement"

See below at "Depth levels" for details.

#### Method
What will the user actually do to complete the action?

#### Live/Expire time
Actions are available to users if the current time is between the action's Live and Expire time.

#### Location
If the action should only be shown to users in a specific area, specify. Otherwise, "anywhere".
